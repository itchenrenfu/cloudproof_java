     * omitting the Offset Items field. If both Offset Items and Maximum Items are specified in the
     * request, the server skips Offset Items objects and returns up to Maximum Items objects. If
     * more than one object satisfies the identification criteria specified in the request, then the
     * response MAY contain Unique Identifiers for multiple Managed Objects. Responses containing
     * Unique Identifiers for multiple objects SHALL be returned in descending order of object
     * creation (most recently created object first). Returned objects SHALL match all of the
     * attributes in the request. If no objects match, then an empty response payload is returned.
     * If no attribute is specified in the request, any object SHALL be deemed to match the Locate
     * request. The response MAY include Located Items which is the count of all objects that
     * satisfy the identification criteria. The server returns a list of Unique Identifiers of the
     * found objects, which then MAY be retrieved using the Get operation. If the objects are
     * archived, then the Recover and Get operations are REQUIRED to be used to obtain those
     * objects. If a single Unique Identifier is returned to the client, then the server SHALL copy
     * the Unique Identifier returned by this operation into the ID Placeholder variable. If the
     * Locate operation matches more than one object, and the Maximum Items value is omitted in the
     * request, or is set to a value larger than one, then the server SHALL empty the ID
     * Placeholder, causing any subsequent operations that are batched with the Locate, and which do
     * not specify a Unique Identifier explicitly, to fail. This ensures that these batched
     * operations SHALL proceed only if a single object is returned by Locate. The Date attributes
     * in the Locate request (e.g., Initial Date, Activation Date, etc.) are used to specify a time
     * or a time range for the search. If a single instance of a given Date attribute is used in the
     * request (e.g., the Activation Date), then objects with the same Date attribute are considered
     * to be matching candidate objects. If two instances of the same Date attribute are used (i.e.,
     * with two different values specifying a range), then objects for which the Date attribute is
     * inside or at a limit of the range are considered to be matching candidate objects. If a Date
     * attribute is set to its largest possible value, then it is equivalent to an undefined
     * attribute. When the Cryptographic Usage Mask attribute is specified in the request, candidate
     * objects are compared against this field via an operation that consists of a logical AND of
     * the requested mask with the mask in the candidate object, and then a comparison of the
     * resulting value with the requested mask. For example, if the request contains a mask value of
     * 10001100010000, and a candidate object mask contains 10000100010000, then the logical AND of
     * the two masks is 10000100010000, which is compared against the mask value in the request
     * (10001100010000) and the match fails. This means that a matching candidate object has all of
     * the bits set in its mask that are set in the requested mask, but MAY have additional bits
     * set. When the Usage Limits attribute is specified in the request, matching candidate objects
     * SHALL have a Usage Limits Count and Usage Limits Total equal to or larger than the values
     * specified in the request. When an attribute that is defined as a structure is specified, all
     * of the structure fields are not REQUIRED to be specified. For instance, for the Link
     * attribute, if the Linked Object Identifier value is specified without the Link Type value,
     * then matching candidate objects have the Linked Object Identifier as specified, irrespective
     * of their Link Type. When the Object Group attribute and the Object Group Member flag are
     * specified in the request, and the value specified for Object Group Member is 'Group Member
     * Fresh', matching candidate objects SHALL be fresh objects from the object group. If there are
     * no more fresh objects in the group, the server MAY choose to generate a new object
     * on-the-fly, based on server policy. If the value specified for Object Group Member is 'Group
     * Member Default', the server locates the default object as defined by server policy. The
     * Storage Status Mask field is used to indicate whether on-line objects (not archived or
     * destroyed), archived objects, destroyed objects or any combination of the above are to be
     * searched.The server SHALL NOT return unique identifiers for objects that are destroyed unless
     * the Storage Status Mask field includes the Destroyed Storage indicator. The server SHALL NOT
     * return unique identifiers for objects that are archived unless the Storage Status Mask field
     * includes the Archived Storage indicator.
